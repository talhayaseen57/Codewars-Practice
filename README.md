# 🧠 Codewars Practice

This repository documents my journey solving coding challenges on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) as part of my ongoing practice and skill development.

I'm starting with **JavaScript**, and will expand to other languages over time. Each solution is structured for clarity, with both the problem statement and my thought process included.


## 📁 Repository Structure

```
JavaScript/
├── 8kyu/         # Beginner level problems
├── 7kyu/         # Beginner level problems
└── ... so on
````

Each problem includes:

* `.md` file – problem description, instructions, and my approach
* `.js` file – the code solution in JavaScript


## 📈 Current Progress

* ✅ 15+ problems solved
* ✅ Multiple difficulty levels attempted
* ✅ Clean and well-commented code
* ✅ Thought process documented for each kata

## 🛠 How to Run

To test a solution:

```bash
node JavaScript/8kyu/example-problem.js
```

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

## 🌱 What's Next?

* Expand to more kyu levels
* Practice daily and iterate solutions
* Add support for other programming languages in future
