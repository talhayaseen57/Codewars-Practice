# 🧠 Codewars Practice

This repository documents my journey solving coding challenges on [Codewars](https://www.codewars.com/) as part of my ongoing practice and skill development.

I'm starting with **JavaScript**, and will expand to other languages over time. Each solution is structured for clarity, with both the problem statement and my thought process included.
